# GoCsvOperation and JWT Generation and Validation

## Introduction

The GoCsvOperation and JWT Generation and Validation project is designed to enable users to upload chunks of data using CSV files into a database, with validation checks performed on the backend after the upload process. Additionally, the project includes functionality for generating JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and validating them, serving as an independent section for learning purposes.

## Features

### CSV Operation
- Users can upload chunks of data using CSV files.
- Backend performs validation checks on the uploaded data.

### JWT Generation and Validation
- Generate JWT tokens for user authentication.
- Validate JWT tokens to ensure secure access.

## Future Scope

- Authentication: Implement user authentication and session management.
- Authorization: Authorize users to upload data based on roles or permissions.

## Technologies Used

- Go: Backend logic implementation.
- PostgreSQL: Database for storing uploaded data.
- JWT: Secure token generation and validation.
- CSV: File format for data upload.

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository.
- Install dependencies.
- Configure environment variables for database connection and JWT secret.
- Run the application.

## Usage

- Upload CSV files containing data chunks.
- Generate JWT tokens for authentication.
- Validate JWT tokens for secure access.
